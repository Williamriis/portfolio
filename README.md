# portfolio

I found this portfolio very difficult to make. It felt like a much bigger project that we have been asked
to make before and I missed using JavaScript. If I had could start again I would start using better
semantic HTML practices, as I used 'div' for everything and then went back afterwards to clean it up, only to
find that this gave me trouble, since different types of HTML elements have different default properties. I
especially struggled with inserting "a" tags around the featured project cards, as this upset the flex styling.
I did not find a solution for this and so right now the "a" tags only surround the images and not the entire card.
